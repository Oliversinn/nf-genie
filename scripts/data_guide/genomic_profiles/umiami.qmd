Direct sequence analysis was performed on genomic DNA isolated from a micro-dissected tumor sample using Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencers. Sequencing was conducted through Caris Life Sciences, utilizing a hybrid pull-down panel of baits to enrich more than 700 clinically relevant genes along with > 20,000 other genes. Base calls are detected from the signal intensity measurements during each cycle. Base Call (BCL) files generated from the Illumina NovaSeq systems are stored on a secure High-Performance Computing server on rapid solid-state hard drives.

The initial sequencing metrics for the flow cells are reviewed by the NGS bioinformatics pipeline, which includes the following run validity criteria and quality control checks: Reads Passing Filter, Yield, and Q30 scores for each read 1 and read 4 (forward and reverse). The pipeline initiates automatic conversion and de-multiplexing using the FPGA-adapted version of bcl2fastq via Illumina DRAGEN devices to convert the Illumina-generated BCL files to FASTQ file formats for downstream analysis. Demultiplexing is performed on the TNA reads, creating sample-specific FASTQ files. Custom software is applied to differentiate RNA and DNA molecules using the synthetic labels added during cDNA synthesis.
