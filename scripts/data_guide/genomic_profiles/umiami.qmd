Direct sequence analysis was performed on genomic DNA isolated from a micro-dissected tumor sample using Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencers. A hybrid pull-down panel of baits was used to enrich more than 700 clinically relevant genes along with > 20,000 other genes. Base calls are detected from the signal intensity measurements during each cycle. Base Call (BCL) files generated from the Illumina NovaSeq systems are stored on a secure High-Performance Computing (HPC) server on rapid solid-state hard drives. The initial sequencing metrics for the flow cells are reviewed by the NGS bioinformatics pipeline which includes the following run validity criteria, quality control (QC) check: Reads Passing Filter (M), Yield (G) and Q30 scores for each read 1 and read 4 (forward and reverse). The pipeline initiates automatic conversion and de-multiplex using the FPGA-adapted version of bcl2fastq via Illumina DRAGEN devices to convert the Illumina-generated BCL files to FASTQ file formats for downstream analysis. Demultiplexing is performed on the TNA reads, creating sample-specific FASTQ files. Custom software is applied to differentiate RNA and DNA molecules using the synthetic labels added during cDNA synthesis. While the test has the capability to detect alterations in RNA via whole transcriptome sequencing (WTS), the test is only approved to report alterations using genomic DNA consistent with the testâ€™s intended use.
